Nevertheless, meta-learning might also refer to the manual process of model selecting and algorithm tuning 
performed by a practitioner on a machine learning project that modern automl algorithms seek to automate. 
It also refers to learning across multiple related predictive modeling tasks, called multi-task learning, 
where meta-learning algorithms learn how to learn.Meta-learning in machine learning most commonly refers 
to machine learning algorithms that learn from the output of other machine learning algorithms.

In our machine learning project where we are trying to figure out (learn) what algorithm performs best on our data,
we could think of a machine learning algorithm taking the place of ourselves, at least to some extent.
Machine learning algorithms learn from historical data. For example, supervised learning algorithms learn how to
map examples of input patterns to examples of output patterns to address classification and regression predictive 
modeling problems.Algorithms are trained on historical data directly to produce a model. The model can then be used later to predict
output values, such as a number or a class label, for new examples of input.
